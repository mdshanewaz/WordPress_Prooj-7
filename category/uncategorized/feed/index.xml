										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you want to blog about sports for fun or career the process is still the same.</p>
<p>You’ll grab a domain + a web hosting account, install WordPress, customize your site and start writing. This may be easier said than done but if you follow these instructions you can have a sports blog online in an hour or less.</p>
<p>Here’s a brief rundown of how to create your own sports blog:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thinking up some ideas</li>
<li>Register a domain + hosting account</li>
<li>Install WordPress</li>
<li>Customize Your Blog Design</li>
<li>Start Blogging!</li>
</ol>
<p>First think about what type of blog you want to run. Will it be a football or baseball blog? Will it be a blog covering local college football or the major leagues?</p>
<p>This topic is also called a “niche” and it’s a crucial first step. You’ll want to figure out your niche before you get a domain because it’ll make the process a lot easier.</p>
<p>Spend a bit of time thinking about what you want to write about. There is no right answer and you can always change course later on. Just pick whatever feels right to the ball rolling.</p>
<p><span id="div-gpt-ad-whatpixel_com-box-3-0" class="ezoic-ad ezoic-adl ezfound" data-google-query-id="CNLFvMnI6O0CFdIPaAodQ8EBaQ"></span>Do you love sharing your opinion on teams &amp; recent games? Then sports blogging might just be your dream job.</p>
<p>It can lead to offers in sports journalism or even a career running your own sports blog. You can focus on a specific team, a specific sport, or all branches of the major(and minor) leagues.<span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-102" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"></span></p>
<div id="google_ads_iframe_/1254144/whatpixel_com-medrectangle-3_0__container__"></div>
<p><img src="https://whatpixel.com/images/2016/12/baseball-stadium-sports-blog.jpg" /></p>
<p><span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-135" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"></span>The biggest hurdle is actually setting up a blog—especially if you don’t have much experience creating websites. And that’s exactly why I made this guide.</p>
<p>I’ll walk you through the entire process of creating a sports blog step-by-step. Along the way you’ll learn how to install &amp; customize WordPress and how to get noticed as a sports blogger.</p>
<p>Regardless of your technical background I guarantee you can launch your own sports blog online. All you have to do is follow this guide and take the first step!</p>

<p>Whether you want to blog about sports for fun or career the process is still the same.</p>
<p>You’ll grab a domain + a web hosting account, install WordPress, customize your site and start writing. This may be easier said than done but if you follow these instructions you can have a sports blog online in an hour or less.</p>

<p>The very first thing you should do is think up some different name ideas for your sports blog.</p>
<p>This can be tough since you’ll really need to consider what you want to write about, how you want to structure your posts, and how frequently you’ll update your blog. Some people would rather update sporadically and treat their blog like a hobby. Others want to make a name for themselves in the sports world.</p>
<p>I recommend studying other popular sports blogs to see what they do. This will help you come up with name ideas that really fit the goals you have for your blog.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="3--step-1-decide-on-your-focus-for-the-sports-blog-"><strong>1. Decide on Your Focus for the Sports Blog</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-426" src="https://mdshanewaz.github.io/WordPress_Prooj-7/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/walking-v1-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" srcset="https://mdshanewaz.github.io/WordPress_Prooj-7/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/walking-v1-300x187.jpg 300w, https://mdshanewaz.github.io/WordPress_Prooj-7/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/walking-v1.jpg 644w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Your first step is to spend a bit of time thinking about the type of sports blog you want to create. The reason why you need to decide on a specific focus for your sports blog is that <em>‘sports’ </em>is such an extensive topic that if you start there, it’s unlikely to do well.</p>
<p>Merely having sports as the theme of your blog is way too large a subject for you to handle on your own, especially at the beginning. There are just too many sports that you could talk about, and too many different elements of each sport to dive into.</p>
<p>It would be impossible for you to be able to focus on every one of them and your audience would be far too large.</p>
<p>A better way to start your sports blog is to focus on one area that you can cover. It’s best if you choose an area where you have previous knowledge and a firm understanding of the players, history, rules, techniques, player transactions, etc.</p>
<p>Ask yourself questions such as:</p>
<p><em>Will my blog be about baseball or football? </em></p>
<p><em>Will it cover major leagues or local college football? </em></p>
<p><em>Do I want to focus on a local team or an entire league?</em></p>
<p><strong>Here are some ideas to get the ball rolling on your brainstorming process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can focus on a local sports team (college, professional, or even high school).</li>
<li>Write about the athletes of the teams including their upbringing and accolades.</li>
<li>Write about the latest sport or athlete news.</li>
<li>Blog about your favorite sports stadiums.</li>
<li>Share information about your favorite team(s).</li>
<li>Cover an entire major league (NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, etc.)</li>
<li>Create articles and reviews of sports clothing and equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>There is no right or wrong when it comes to choosing a focus for your blog. </strong></p>
<p>However, it’s important to choose something that you will enjoy writing about on a consistent basis for months and years to come.</p>
<p>You should also note that you can always change your focus later, so pick whatever feels right and move on to the next step.</p>

<p>You should never try to become the ESPN of blogs. Instead, you need to choose a specific topic that you will focus on so you can become an authority on that topic.</p>
<p>Choosing a specific niche for your sports blog increases your chances of getting more targeted traffic, and therefore <a href="http://www.onehourprofessor.com/blog-vs-website-what-is-better-for-making-money/" data-wpel-link="internal">making more money from your blog</a>.</p>
<p>So, instead of trying to appeal to a huge mass of people with varied interests, your blog needs to cater to a targeted audience.</p>
<p>By doing this, you will not only make your journey to becoming an industry expert easier and more proficient, but having a targeted audience will also help you reach out and connect with the right people in all your marketing endeavors.</p>
<p>Finding your niche is a crucial step that will help ensure that you build a firm foundation for your sports blog. Listed below are some of the most popular and <a href="https://sportsshow.net/most-popular-sports-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">most watched sports in America</a> that generate the highest revenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coffee is so much more than a beverage — it’s a community. By taking a look through some of the best coffee blogs out there, you’ll get an introduction to just <a class="customize-unpreviewable" href="https://club.atlascoffeeclub.com/category/travel/">how broad and diverse the world of coffee really is</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re a novice whose infatuation is rapidly turning into something more serious. Or maybe you’re a connoisseur with a thirst for knowledge on <a class="customize-unpreviewable" href="https://club.atlascoffeeclub.com/cold-brew-french-press/">brewing techniques</a>. A lot of these bloggers have been there, and they enthusiastically share tips, experiments, and comparisons that will have you making top-notch craft brews in no time.</p>
<p>The social aspect of coffee drives some other blogs, which focus on coffee-forward global travel itineraries and coffee destinations, and introduce you to the people behind them. With coffee and community being inseparable, many of the best coffee blogs also touch on issues like sustainability and ethics. We all like a beverage we can really feel good about, and these blogs will help you get there.</p>
<p>In this selection of some of the best coffee blogs we know (presented in no particular order), you’re sure to find new things to love about coffee. Welcome to the conversation.</p>
<h2 id="h.mhqwnd2wy2k3">1. Coffee Cantata</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1578" src="https://mdshanewaz.github.io/WordPress_Prooj-7/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bp-2-300x300.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://mdshanewaz.github.io/WordPress_Prooj-7/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bp-2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://mdshanewaz.github.io/WordPress_Prooj-7/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bp-2-150x150.jpg 150w" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>The catchphrase for <a class="customize-unpreviewable" href="https://coffeecantata.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee Cantata</a>, “Coffee: Music in a Cup,” captures creator Margaret’s unpretentious approach to coffee connoisseurship. Her coffee reviews are cross-referenced by geographic origin and brew method. The precise details of the extraction process, like temperature and coffee-to-water ratio, are meticulously recorded so you can repeat the experience at home. Her tasting notes are vivid and delightful and they include serving thoughts, such as how the brew pairs with milk.</p>
<p>Margaret — a professional musician — brings finesse to the art of tasting: “… one sip of an Ethiopia Yirgacheffe and you will never mistake the flavor for a Sumatra, just like you would never mistake Mozart for Shostakovich.”</p>
<p>Her “off-topic” pieces also make excellent reading while you enjoy a carefully brewed, fresh cup of coffee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coffee is so much more than a beverage — it’s a community. By taking a look through some of the best coffee blogs out there, you’ll get an introduction to just <a href="https://club.atlascoffeeclub.com/category/travel/">how broad and diverse the world of coffee really is</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re a novice whose infatuation is rapidly turning into something more serious. Or maybe you’re a connoisseur with a thirst for knowledge on <a href="https://club.atlascoffeeclub.com/cold-brew-french-press/">brewing techniques</a>. A lot of these bloggers have been there, and they enthusiastically share tips, experiments, and comparisons that will have you making top-notch craft brews in no time.</p>
<p>The social aspect of coffee drives some other blogs, which focus on coffee-forward global travel itineraries and coffee destinations, and introduce you to the people behind them. With coffee and community being inseparable, many of the best coffee blogs also touch on issues like sustainability and ethics. We all like a beverage we can really feel good about, and these blogs will help you get there.</p>
<p>In this selection of some of the best coffee blogs we know (presented in no particular order), you’re sure to find new things to love about coffee. Welcome to the conversation.</p>
<h2 id="h.mhqwnd2wy2k3">1. Coffee Cantata</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1578" src="https://mdshanewaz.github.io/WordPress_Prooj-7/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bp-2-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://mdshanewaz.github.io/WordPress_Prooj-7/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bp-2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://mdshanewaz.github.io/WordPress_Prooj-7/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bp-2-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The catchphrase for <a href="https://coffeecantata.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee Cantata</a>, “Coffee: Music in a Cup,” captures creator Margaret’s unpretentious approach to coffee connoisseurship. Her coffee reviews are cross-referenced by geographic origin and brew method. The precise details of the extraction process, like temperature and coffee-to-water ratio, are meticulously recorded so you can repeat the experience at home. Her tasting notes are vivid and delightful and they include serving thoughts, such as how the brew pairs with milk.</p>
<p>Margaret — a professional musician — brings finesse to the art of tasting: “… one sip of an Ethiopia Yirgacheffe and you will never mistake the flavor for a Sumatra, just like you would never mistake Mozart for Shostakovich.”</p>
<p>Her “off-topic” pieces also make excellent reading while you enjoy a carefully brewed, fresh cup of coffee.</p>
